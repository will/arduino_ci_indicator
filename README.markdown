Arduino Continuos Integration Indicator
=======================================

What good is CI if you don't know the build status? And what's a better way to know the status than blinking LEDs?

arduino_serial.rb
-----------------

This sends a signal to the arduino to tell it to switch states.

    ./arduino_serial.rb character
    character:
      r => red, failed build
      g => green, successful build
      else => toggle status
      
You'll have to figure out the serial port and edit that into the script. Also if when you do this it rests your arudino, it's because the version you have resets itself automatically on receiving serial data. Lucky you. The only way to get around this that I could work out was putting a resistor between the 5v and reset pins, to prevent it from resetting. **Warning:** Take that resistor out before updating the arduino, or your computer will hang and everything goes to hell.

ci_idicator.rb
--------------

This is the code that gets compiled down to C and put on the arduino using [RAD]("http://rad.rubyforge.org/"). Rad uses some old version of ParseTree, so I had to put `gem "ParseTree", "2.2.0"` in the Rakefile to get it to use the old version. They might fix that sometime, but there you go.
